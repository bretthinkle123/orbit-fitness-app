# Deterministic supply-chain integrity check (M6). Inspects the working-tree change
# set (tracked diff + untracked files vs HEAD — the same set the rest of the pipeline
# scopes to) for two problems:
#   1. a dependency MANIFEST changed but its LOCKFILE did not (deps left unlocked /
#      unresolved — the classic "it works on my machine" + supply-chain drift risk)
#   2. UNPINNED version specifiers entering a changed manifest (floating deps)
#   3. a LOCKFILE changed with no manifest change (a re-lock — usually fine, but worth
#      a glance in case a dependency was injected)
#
# Run by the security agent as part of its scan; its findings fold into
# security-report.md / security-status.json, so a hard violation rides the EXISTING
# security gate — no new gate hook. Zero-LLM, deterministic.
#
# Exit: 0 = clean · 1 = warnings only (unpinned dep / bare re-lock) · 2 = BLOCK
#       (a manifest changed without its lockfile).
