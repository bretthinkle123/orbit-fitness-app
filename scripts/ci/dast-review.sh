# dast-review.sh — DAST Layer 1 budget compare (deterministic; the testable half).
#
# The runtime-heavy scan (boot the app, run OWASP ZAP's passive baseline against it) is done by
# dast-capture.sh and written to .pipeline/dast-capture.json (a raw ZAP JSON report). THIS hook is
# pure jq: it tallies that report's alerts by severity and compares them against the project's
# budget (.pipeline/dast-budget.json — a per-severity cap on how many findings may ship), then
# writes an **advisory** .pipeline/dast-review.json listing anything over budget.
#
# ADVISORY, never a gate: a passive DAST baseline is a signal, not a deploy-blocker (it can
# false-positive on framework defaults, and it runs post-GREEN outside the security loop). The
# deploy-side teeth stay the pre-merge scanners + human diff review; documentation surfaces this in
# the PR. No deploy-gate / loop-exit reads it → zero loop-exit-invariant churn. Absent capture ⇒
# no-op (Docker not provisioned, no dast.env, or a non-HTTP project) — exactly like the design-review
# / egress / asvs-sast signal hooks. The gating layers (authenticated + active fuzzing) live in CI
# against staging (plan/dast-plan.md Layers 2-3), not here.
